# Tutorial

This Project is a Tutorial to set up your model for hyperparameter search using the cluster-hyperopt repository.

In this tutorial we will create:
0. a simple model, that is not yet usable for hyperparameter search
1. a function, that will be called by the hyperparameter search algorithm
2. the config file, that defines all necessary parameters
